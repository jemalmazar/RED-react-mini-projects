# RED Academy Mini-Projects in React

**Project Description**

This small project was used to demonstrate basic functionality of the React library.

**Tools & Methods Used**

- HTML
- React

**What I Learned**
- most React classes/components have a render method
- the render method renders to a single DOM element/node
- the _this_ keyword refers to the parent class
- the _getInitialState_ method holds different _states_, which are properties that change over time
- _props_ are very similar to state but are attributes of a component that do not change
